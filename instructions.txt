Hello! Welcome to this interactive experience to learn about Brisbane's Inner City! To begin, use the joystick to move your interaction field around the screen. This field can be magnified using the "1" key, or zoomed out using the "2" key. To select one of the regions on the map, highlighted by a black square, hover over the object and hit "3". To hide the description of a location, simply hit "3" on a highlighted region again :). I hope you enjoy learning in this experience, and enjoy exploring Brisbane, Queensland!
